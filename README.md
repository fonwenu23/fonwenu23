I'm a security engineer based in Michigan with a keen interest in understanding the details of how things work. In my current role, I tackle operations and engineering tasks focused on enhancing security applications and tools. My aspiration is to transition into DevOps to gain deeper insights into software deployment processes. Beyond my professional pursuits, I find joy in activities like playing chess, indulging in FPS video games, and cherishing moments with my family. Currently, I'm learning about containers, pipelines, APIs, and Python. Feel free to reach out to me via email ðŸ“¬ with any questions or discussions. Looking forward to connecting with you soon!
